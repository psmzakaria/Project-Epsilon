      E-waste is discarded electronics that, when improperly disposed, have the
      potential of harming our ecosystem.E-waste encompasses a long list of
      devices.Since you can’t just put these objects in the regular trash, we
      require with alternative methods for their disposal — like recycling
      events or other drop-off locations. E-waste is growing, and with that
      surge comes the need for effective electronics recycling programs.People
      are urgently looking for information on TV recycling, computer recycling,
      and other programs that will help them responsibly get rid of unwanted
      equipment ​while minimizing any risk of information or identity theft.We
      aim to provide the required information for optimized recycling.
